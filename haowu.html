            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                The project was inspired by online shoppers that spent a majority of their time jumping between multiple retailing websites 
                to find a better deal. Users could be able to find a product with the best price on a reliable website more efficiently if 
                there was a service built for their needs to create an overall better online shopping experience that helps save their time. 
                Haowu is a service that proposes to enable users to maximise their online shopping efficiency by allowing them to 
                simultaneously track items and prices across multiple vendors for the best deals.
            </p>
            <p><em>*This is a fictional project.</em></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Research </h3>
        <p>
            Secondary research was conducted to gain a foundational level of understanding of online shopping and marketing. According to 
            the results, it was found that the Coronavirus pandemic had accelerated ecommerce growth and exponentially increased the sales 
            of online products. It was also found to have an impact on consumer behaviour; consumers have shifted to digital channels for 
            their purchasing needs and are likely to retain this behaviour succeeding the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Subsequently, five user interviews were conducted with users that possessed online shopping experience to obtain a better 
            understanding of their goals and difficulties buying products online. The interviews focused on understanding user demographics 
            and online shopping behaviours.
        </p>

        <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
        <p>
            Following the analysis of the existing market, a competitor analysis was conducted on alternate retailing channels' strengths, 
            weaknesses and available features. A majority of products were found to have implemented a notification system for price updated, 
            including eBay, Amazon and Kmart.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h4>User Interview Results</h4>
        <p>
            Based on interview results, the action of finding the best deal for a product was very time consuming as users had to manually 
            compare prices across multiple online retailers. 
        </p>

            <div class="idea-card bg-yellow">
                <p>3/5 Users compared prices of a single item from multiple websites before considering purchasing.</p>

                <p>2/5 Users were pleased with the transparency of the prices and sale amounts of online items.</p>

            <div class="idea-card bg-blue"> 
                <p>3/5 Users didn't trust prices listed on Google, believing for them to be out of date or inaccurate</p>

        <h4>Empathy Map</h4>
        <p>
            This empathy map draws out unexpected insights revolving around users' needs, based on the observations gathered from 
            the interview data.

            A persona was created to identify the target users based on the collected research data.<br>Sam frequently shops online 
            and prefers a simple and fast experience with a high standard of quality.

        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <p>
            Users find themselves frustrated when spending too much time manually comparing prices, finding sales and coupons and avoiding 
            fake and unreliable websites while trying to find the best deals for their desired products while online shopping.
        </p>
        <p>
            A platform that identifies the up-to-date pricings of user desired products from trustworthy online vendors will allow users 
            to increase their shopping productivity and create a reassuring online shopping experience.
        </p>

        <h4>Storyboard</h4>
        <p>A storyboard was created to shape the user persona and accumulate product requirements.</p>

            The user's journey is broken down into stages, each analysing the determined potential opportunities that could help solve 
            the persona's frustrations and concerns.

        </div>

        <h4>Product Roadmap</h4>
        <p>
            Following the brainstorming of potential solutions for the service, features were selected and prioritised based on impact, 
            cost, ease of implementation and time constraints. There were two main areas focus:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Latest prices from various retailers to be visible from one page</li>
            <li>Users should be able to purchase an item at sale price until the end of the sale period</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/haowu-road-map.png">
        </div>

        <h4>User Flow</h4>
        <p>Structure of the app was determined based on problem statement and product roadmap.</p>

        <h3>Ideate</h3>
        <h4>Low-Fidelity Sketches</h4>
        <p>
            Ideas were sketched out on paper, with different ideas being explored and further refined. This process was conducted alongside
            competitors' mobile design patterns as a reference.
        </p>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">

        <h4>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/haowu-lofi-wireframe.png">
        </div>

        <h4>User Testing Feedback</h4>
        <p>
            Wireframes were tested against 3 participants to identify any difficulties when using the current design layout. It was observed 
            that all users were able to complete their assigned tasks but had found it difficult to recognise interactive links and buttons. 
            Users also mentioned that the content found in product cards was hard to follow.
        </p>

        <h4>Low-Fidelity Iterations</h4>
        <p>
            Wireframes were revised following user testing feedback, where CTAs were introduced to highlight important interactive elements 
            and content held within product cards was reorganised to highlight the product image and group texts together to improve 
            readability.
        </p>

                <img src="images/haowu-iteration2.png">
            </div>
        </div>

        <h4>High-Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
        <p>
            Further development and refining of wireframes into a high-fidelity stage was completed based on user recommendations. Green 
            was the chosen colour for the CTAs as it symbolises inviting, friendly and approachable themes, which will result in making 
            the interactive elements a more obvious part of the UI design.
        </p>

            <img src="images/haowu-hifi.png">
        </div>
        
        <h4>Next Steps</h4>
        <p>
            If given more time, it would be beneficial to conduct another round of usability testing to validate the buying process and 
            identify difficulties when shifting to third parties for checkout. Development of this app into a responsive service would also 
            be an advantageous decision, allowing users to access the service through multiple digital platforms.
        </p>

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
            The Haowu mobile app as a UX design project was an amazing learning journey to experience. It was enlightening to observe how 
            testing participants offered positive and constructive feedback on the incorporated design features and how they were eager to 
            follow along on how the app would be deployed as a real-world product.
