            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>This project was inspired by the online shoppers around me who spent lots of time jumping between multiple retailing websites to find a better deal.

                I believe that if I could help users find a product with a better price on a reliable website more efficiently by building a service that suits their needs, I would be able to create a better online shopping experience and help users to save time.
                
                So I decided to create a service that enables users to <mark>maximise their online shopping efficiency</mark> by allowing them to <mark>simultaneously</mark> track items and prices arcoss multiple vendors for the best outcome.</p>
            <p><em>*This is a fictional project.</em></p>
        </div>

        <h3>Research </h3>
        <h4>User Interviews</h4>
        <p>In order to get a better understanding of the topic area, I first conducted a secondary research in order to know more about the various types of online shopping tools out there and how it currently works. 
            According to the result, Coronavirus pandemin has accelerated ecommerce growth to a country’s ecommerce sales and has also changed consumer behaviour - consumers shift to <mark class="green">digital channels </mark>will remain after the pandemic. I also found that the use of smartphones for online shopping has more than doubled since 2018.</p>
        <p>To better understand the industry market, I moved onto researching current products.</p>

        <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
        <p>I created a competitor analysis after analysing the existing market. I’d like to find out what other retailing channels are doing, and also analyse their strengths, weakesses and types of features. What I found was majority of products are able to notify users on price updates and are supported by a range of official stores such as eBay, Amazon and Kmart.</p>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">

        </div>

        <h4>Survey and 1:1 user interviews</h4>
        <p>I conducted 5 user interviews with people I know who experienced online shopping in Australia before, getting to know what <mark class="yellow">difficulties</mark> they’ve confronted and what <mark class="blue">goals</mark> they’re trying to achieve while shopping online.  Based on the interview results, the process of finding a better deal for an item was very time-consuming and challenging because users had to <mark class="green">manually compare prices </mark>among multiple retailing websites.
            Here were the findings:
        </p>

        <div class="grid-container-triplet">

            <div class="idea-card bg-yellow">
                <p>3/5 of them compared prices on multiple websites when they considered to buy one item</p>
            </div>

            <div class="idea-card bg-orange"> 
                <p>2/5 of them had a pleasant experience because transparency of price and sale amount</p>
            </div>

            <div class="idea-card bg-blue"> 
                <p>3/5 of them didn’t trust if prices listed out on Google were up-to-date or accurate</p>
            </div>

        </div>

        <p>The interview focused on understanding users’ demographics and online shopping behaviors. The interview data helped me empathise and synthesise the observations, so I used Empathy map to draw out unexpected insights about the user's needs.</p>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/haowu-empathy.png">
        </div>

        <h4>Persona</h4>
        <p>Based on all the research data I have gathered, a user has been identified. Therefore I created a persona to help me picture the target users. </p>
        <p>Sam shop frequently online and he likes <mark class="green">simple and fast experience</mark> with good quality.</p>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/haowu-persona.png">
        </div>

        <h3>Define</h3>
        <p>Based on the person I generated, I then start to brainstorm possibilities for the service. Then, I selected and prioritised the features based on the highest impact and the lowest costs, ease of implementation and time constraint. </p>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/haowu-ideation.png">
        </div>
        
        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <p>Sam Gibson needs to effectively and wisely increase his <mark class="blue">shopping productivity</mark> with reliable retailers because of having to manually compare prices, find sales & coupons and avoid fake sites are time-wasting.</p>
        <p>I believe that by creating a platform that identifies trustworthy retailers and displays <mark class="green"> up-to-date pricing </mark> of the desired item for people who spend too much time filtering for reliable sellers and good deals will allow them to increase shopping productivity and therefore create an efficient and reassuring online shopping experience which ultimately results in a better experience and wants to bring them back.</p>

        <h4>Storyboard</h4>
        <p>In order to shape the user persona and to develop requirements for the product, I created a storyboard to make the idea clear.</p>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/haowu-story.png">
        </div>

        <h4>User journey map</h4>
        <p>I mapped out the user’s journey in order to break it down into stages.  For each stage, I analysed and determined the potential opportunities that could help solve Sam’s concerns and frustrations. I started brainstorming by listing down the ways how I can make the user's before and after reach out Haowu experiences' <mark>worry-free</mark>.</p>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/haowu-user-journey.png">
        </div>

        <h4>Product roadmap</h4>
        <p>After brainstorming potential solutions, I then selected and prioritised the features based on the highest impact, ease of implementation and time constraint.</p>
        <p>I focused on two main areas: </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>the latest prices from various retailers are <mark class="green">visible</mark> on one page</li>
            <li>users will not miss out the buying chance before the sale ends</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/haowu-road-map.png">
        </div>

        <h4>User flow</h4>
        <p>I referred back to the problem statement & product roadmap and started determining the structure of the app.</p>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/haowu-userflow.png">
        </div>

        <h3>Ideate</h3>
        <h4>Low fidelity sketches</h4>
        <p>I began by sketching out ideas on paper then I explored and refined some of the ideas down further. Through this process, I referenced back and forth to analysise competitors’ mobile design patterns.</p>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/haowu-sketches.png">
        </div>

        <h4>Low fidelity wireframes</h4>
        <p>After knowing what I would be designing, I started wireframing for the prototype.</p>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/haowu-lofi-wireframe.png">
        </div>

        <h4>User testing feedback</h4>
        <p>I I tested out the wireframes with a total of 3 participants to find out if there is any difficulty with using it. Throughout the sessions, I observed and took notes. All users were able to complete the tasks but they found difficult to recognise interactive links/buttons.  Users also mentioned that the content in the card was hard to follow.</p>

        <h4>Iterations</h4>
        <p>I revised the wireframes based on users’ feedback and I decided to use CTAs to highlight some important interactive elements. I also reorganised the content in the card by highlighting the image and grouped texts together to improve readability.</p>

        <div class="grid-container-twin">
            <div class="container-static-card">
                <img src="images/haowu-iteration1.png">
            </div>
            
            <div class="container-static-card">
                <img src="images/haowu-iteration2.png">
            </div>
        </div>

        <h4>High fidelity wireframes</h4>
        <p>I then revised the wireframes based on the recommendations. I decided to use color <mark class="green">green</mark> as the CTA’s color because it is <mark class="orange">inviting, friendly and approachable</mark> which will also make the interactive elements more obvious through UI design. Then I updated the entire wireframes with the UI elements in order to create a high-fidelity wireframes.</p>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/haowu-hifi.png">
        </div>
        
        <h4>Next step</h4>
        <p>If I was given more time, I would love to conduct another round of usability test for the <mark class="orange">buying process</mark> in order to find out possible difficulties when jumping to the third parties to checkout. </p>
        <p>I’d also like to develop this app into <mark class="yellow">a responsive service</mark> where users can access through multiple digital devices, this is becuase people use not only mobile phones but also laptops and iPads for online shopping. </p>

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>Haowu mobile app is my first UX design project. Even though there were many obstacles along the way, I really had <mark class="blue">an amazing learning journey</mark> throughout the experience. It was also great to see how participants offered positive and constructive feedback on the design features that I have incorporated which excited them to see how the app will be deployed as a real-world product. </p>
