            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                This project was inspired by people who had trouble locating the contact information on the RSPCA website 
                as they were attempting to report animal abuse or injuries as soon as possible. According to the RSPCA Australia National Statistics 
                2020-2021, each year between 2015 and 2021, an average of <mark>over 63,390 animal cruelty complaints </mark>were made. 
                RSPCA Victoria, which receives the vast majority of complaints, emphasised during consultation that their primary goal 
                was to promote the welfare of animals, and that this is often best achieved through providing assistance and education.
                This project aims to redesign the RSPCA website to reimagine users' accessibility to reporting animal abuse and injuries.
            </p>
                
            <p><em>*This is a fictional project.</em></p>

        </div>
                
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>
            Five one-on-one user interviews were conducted with people who had experience in reporting lost or injured animals in Australia 
            to recognise the difficulties users may confront while attempting to contact animal welfare services. Based on interview results, 
            identification of RSPCA contact information was deemed confusing and time-consuming, resulting in users contacting alternative 
            animal rescue services for immediate help. 
        </p>


        <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
        <p>
            Underwent research that involved available alternatives on the existing market for animal welfare and rescue, analysing their 
            available features in comparison to RSPCA. A majority of products were found to display contact details on their websites' 
            landing pages, aligned to their mission.
        </p>

        <h4>Features of Competitor Websites</h4>
        <ul>

            It was found that users spent most of their time trying to locate the correct contact number and that waiting times for 
            calls were very unpredictable. 
        </p>

            <li>3/5 Users visited the RSPCA website for animal adoptions, however the listings were not up to date</li>

        <p>Based on research data, a user was identified, and a persona was created to portray target users:</p>

        <p>
            Chloe is an animal lover who enjoys frequently visiting the wildlife living in different regional parks in Victoria. 
            As a result, it is important for her to easily and confidently navigate to RSPCAâ€™s contact info in an animal rescue emergency.

        <h3>Define</h3>
        <p>Identify and prioritise features based on impact, costs, ease of implementation and time constraint.</p>
        
        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <p>
            Users spend and considerable amount of time attempting to located contact information on the RSPCA website 
            and are frustrated by the lack of prompt responses received, causing stress for both RSPCA staff and users 
            who are in need of this information in a timely manner.
        </p>

        <p>Improvements to be made:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Easy to find support resources</li>
            <li>Right information available at the right moment</li>
            <li>Available and easily identifiable contact information</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>User Journey Map</h4>
        <p>
            The user's journey is broken down into stages, each analysing the determined potential opportunities that 
            could help solve the persona's frustrations and concerns.

        <h4>Sitemap</h4>
        <p>
            The RSPCA website was found to have an excessive number of categories and cards within their navigation system, 
            causing possible confusion for users. In order to address this problem, the website was decided to be restructured 
            in a way that allowed for users to identify the types of community services and support RSPCA provides.
        </p>

        <p>Focus Areas of Improvement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quick access to animal rescue services</li>
            <li>Easily navigable web structure</li>
            <li>Key user desired information readily available</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Low-Fidelity Sketches</h4>
        <p>
            A mobile-first approach was utilised to ensure only the most essential features were included. Ideas were explored and refined 
            on paper, referencing competitors' web and app design patterns.

        <h4>User Testing Feedback</h4>
        <p>
            Sketches were tested with four participants to identify any difficulties and opinions. It was noted that all users were able
            to complete given tasks, however some had found some elements to be challenging to notice due to the low fidelity of the 
            prototype.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Users felt overwhelmed by the number of options in the header</li>
            <li>Users noticed that the card (which one??) gathered more attention in comparison to the CTAs</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
        <p>
            The created wireframes were iterated on based on users' feedback. The header for the mobile version was rearranged in order 
            to direct user attention to the CTAs.
        </p>

        <h4>UI Style Guide</h4>
        <p>
            The original RSPCA colour scheme was revised in order to more accurately align with their goal to <em>'prevent cruelty to 
            animals by actively promoting their care and protection'</em>. Two iterations of colour schemes were experimented on to evaluate 
            if users would be able to associate these colours with the brand's goals.
        </p>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/rspca-color-selection.png">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Following user feedback, the original colour scheme viewed the current RSPCA website was found to be outdated, cold and old-styled. 
        </p>

        <p>In continuation, A/B user testing was conducted with the following test objectives:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Is the site recognisable upon first impression as the RSPCA website?</li>
            <li>Does the site feel easy to navigate with intuitive locations of products and features?</li>
            <li>Are the categories understandable?</li>
            <li>Does the site feel friendly and trustworthy?</li>
            <li>Does any of the site feel complicated or overwhelming?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Feedback included users describing colour scheme 1 as <em>'cute, but not very motivative'</em> and colour scheme 2 as <em>'warm and inviting'</em>. 
            Below are developed iterations based on this feedback.
        </p>

        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/rspca-user-testing.png">
        </div>
        
        <p>
            As a result, a new UI style guide was implemented, employing colour scheme 2, which focuses on producing a reliable and encouraging 
            brand tone reflecting the philosophy of RSPCA for the new design.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
            Due to the complexity of the project, highlighting the contact details within RSPCA's website was mainly focused. If given 
            more time, further exploration on the opinions and expectations from stakeholdersâ€™ perspectives would be ideal. On top of 
            that, considering that animal adoption is one of the major features of RSPCA and that users have mentioned the system to be 
            'not up-to-dateâ€™, reimagining this feature could also be a future possibility.
