            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                This project was inspired by the people around me who had trouble locating contact info on the RSPCA website when it comes to report injuried animals. 
                
                According to RSPCA Australia National Statistics 2020-2021, each year between 2015 and 2021 in Australia, an average of <mark>over 63,390 animal cruelty complaints </mark>were made. 
                
                RSPCA Victoria, which receives the vast majority of complaints, emphasised during consultation that their primary goal is to promote the welfare of animals, and that this is often best achieved through providing assistance and education.
                
                So I decided to redesign their website to reimagine how users experience reporting animal abuse to RSPCA Australia.
            </p>
                
            <p><em>*This is a fictional project.</em></p>

        </div>
                
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>In order to get a better understanding of the topic area, I first conducted 5 user interviews with people I know who experienced reporting lost/injured animals in Australia  before, getting to know what difficulties they’ve confronted and what they’re looking for while contacting the animal welfare services.  Based on the interview results, the process of finding RSPCA contact informtion was very confusing and time-consuming and people had to end up calling other animal rescue services for help. </p>
        <p>To better understand the industry market, I moved onto researching available products.</p>
        <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
        <p>I created a competitor analysis after looking at the existing market. I’d like to find out what other animal welfare organisations are doing, and also analyse their strengths, weakesses and types of features. What I found was majority of products have their contact details displayed right up front ailgned to the mission of the website. </p>

        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/rspca-competitor-analysis.png">
        </div>

        <h4>Things I could learn from the competitors:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Clear messaging of key motives: Rescue, Volunteer and Donate</li>
            <li>Contact details displayed right up front aligned to the mission of the website</li>
            <li><mark class="blue">Clear messaging</mark> of what's important</li>
            <li>Interactive elements are <mark class="orange">easy to identify</mark></li>
            <li>Thoughtfully written structures with warming ux writing</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Survey and 1:1 user interviews</h4>
        <p>In order to understand more about what users' experiences are like with animal rescue, I conducted a survey and  five 1:1 user interviews. These would help me gain more qualitative data directly from users.</p>
        <p>Through these I found that people spent lots of time finding the right number to call when they saw an animal injury and the waiting time was very unpredictable. Here were the findings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3/5 of them had experience calling to RSPCA for animal rescue </li>
            <li>3/5 of them visited RSPCA website for <mark>animal adoptions</mark> but the stock wasn’t up-to-date</li>
            <li>3/5 of them mentioned finding their contact details was <mark>challenging</mark></li>
            <li>2/5 of them trusted city council rescuing services more because they were more responding</li>
            <li>3/5 of them mentioned the website was very <mark>outdated</mark> and poor maintained</li>
            <li>1/5 of them mentioned responses to enquiry online were very slow</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="link" onclick="window.open('https://forms.gle/nYF3FHvMrtdUH2e96')"><em>Online survey</em></h4>
    
        <h4>Persona</h4>
        <p>Based on all the research data I have gathered, a user has been identified. Therefore I created a persona to help me picture the target users. </p>
        <p>Chloe likes animals and she would visit unfamiliar parks in regional Victoria quite often. So it is important for her to be able to easily and confidently navigate RSPCA’s contact info when necessary. </p>

        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/rspca-persona.png">
        </div>

        <h3>Define</h3>
        <p>After brainstorming potential solutions, I then selected and prioritised the features based on the highest impact and the lowest costs, ease of implementation and time constraint. </p>
        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        <p>Users have spent a considerable amount of time trying to locate contact information for the RSPCA website and are frustrated at the lack of prompt responses received from RSPCA. This situation causes stress for both staff and users who are in need of this information in a timely manner.</p>
        <p>These are the <mark class="blue">improvements</mark> I aim to make:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>support resources <mark class="green">easy to find</mark></li>
            <li>right info is available <mark class="orange">at the right moment</mark></li>
            <li>Contact information is available and <mark class="yellow">easily identifiable</mark></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>User journey map</h4>
        <p>I mapped out the user’s journey in order to break it down into stages.  For each stage, I analysed and determined the potential opportunities that could help solve Chloe’s concerns and frustrations. I started brainstorming by listing down the ways how I can make the user's before and after reach out RSPCA experiences' worry-free.</p>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/rspca-user-journey.png">
        </div>
        
        <h4>Sitemap</h4>
        <p>After brainstorming potential solutions, I then selected and prioritised the features based on the highest impact, ease of implementation and time constraint. Considering that RSPCA has way too many categories and cards that may confuse users, I decided to restructure the website that allows users to identify what actual services/support RSPCA provides to the community. </p>
        <p>I focused on improving 2 areas: 
        <ul>
            <li><mark class="green">quick access</mark> to animal rescue services</li>
            <li>users know where they are and get the right info at the right moment throughtout the experience</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/userflow.png">
        </div>

        <h4>User flow</h4>
        <p>I referred back to the problem statement & sitemap and started determine the ways the user might navigate in order to access to animal rescue services as quick as possible and find support resources effortlessly.</p>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/rspca-sitemap.png">
        </div>

        <h3>Ideate</h3>
        
        <h4>Low fidelity sketches</h4>
        <p>Based on ‘mobile first design’, I decided to start with the mobile version. First, I began by sketching out ideas on paper then I explored and refined some of the ideas down further. Through this process, I referenced back and forth to analysise competitors’ web design patterns.</p>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/rspca-sketch1.png">
        </div>
        
        <p>Knowing the most essential features of the product, I then started to sketch for the desktop version.</p>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/rspca-sketch2.png">
        </div>
        
        <h4>User testing feedback</h4>
        <p>I I tested out the sketches with a total of 4 participants to see what they think of it and if there is any difficulty with using it. Throughout the sessions, I observed and took notes. All users were able to complete the tasks. Since it was a low-fidelity prototype, some users found some buttons uneasily noticeable. 
            Here are some findings:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>felt a bit overwhelmed by the number of options given on the header, so I decided to reorganise the positions of 2 CTAs</li>
            <li>the card grabbed more attention than the CTAs, I may consider enlarging the CTAs</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Low fidelity wireframes</h4>
        <p>After knowing what I would be designing, I started wireframing for the prototype.</p>

        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/wireframing-mobile.png">
        </div>

        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/wireframing-desktop.png">
        </div>
        
        <p>I then revised the wireframes based on user’s’ feedback. I decided to reorder the header for the mobile version in this way because it allows the users to notice the CTAs without being disturbed by other buttons. 
            Then I updated the entire wireframes with the UI elements in order to create a high-fidelity wireframes.
        </p>
        
        <h4>UI style guide</h4>
        <p>I revised the original RSPCA’s color schemes and considering that RSPCA’s goals are to <mark>prevent cruelty to animals by actively promoting their care and protection</mark>, I experimented with 2 iterations of color schemes to evaluate how users would feel towards the brand’s goals.</p>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/rspca-color-selection.png">
        </div>
        
        <p>The original color scheme was found to be outdated because users described their feelings as <em>cold</em> and <em>old-styled</em> when they viewed the current RSPCA website. I then did a round of A/B user testing which resulted in users describing the color scheme 1 as <em>cute but not very motivative</em> and the color scheme 2 as <em>warm and inviting</em>.</p>
        <p>Below are the test objectives.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On first impression, is the site <mark class="orange">recognisable</mark> as the RSPCA website?</li>
            <li>Does the site feel  <mark class="blue">easy to navigate</mark>? Is it easy and intuitive to locate products and features?</li>
            <li> Do the <mark class="green">categories</mark> make sense?</li>
            <li>Does the site feel friendly and accessible yet trustworthy?</li>
            <li>Does anything feel <mark class="yellow">complicated or overwhelming</mark>?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Below are iterations I’ve made based on the A/B user testing’s feedback.</p>

        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/rspca-user-testing.png">
        </div>
        
        <p>Therefore, I referred back to the philosophy of RSPCA and created a UI style guide with the color scheme 2, aiming to produce a <mark>reliable and encouraging brand tone</mark> for the new design.</p>
        
        <div class="container-static-card">
            <img src="images/rspca-style-guide.png">
        </div>

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>Due to the complexity of the project, I chose to only focus on highlighting RSPCA’s contact details within the website to solve the problem of reporting animal injuries. If I was given more time, I would like to explore this project by digging out opinions and expectations from stakeholders’ perspectives. On top of that, considering animal adoption is one of the major features of RSPCA and that users have mentioned that ‘it is not up-to-date’, reimagining this feature could also be an area to work on in the future. </p>
